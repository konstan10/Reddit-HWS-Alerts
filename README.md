# Reddit-HWS-Alerts
Simple script I wrote in Python that alerts you of new r/hardwareswap posts based on a keyword or phrase of your choice. Simply open the script, edit the keyword field for what you want to search for, and edit the time field for how often you want the page to refresh. Run in your terminal with "python3 scrapehws.py"
